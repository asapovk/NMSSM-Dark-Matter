In order to script a run.

You have to write a file with all the command that you type. (in that exact order).
Note that
   1. You can enter the answer to question as well
   2. If you do not provide answer to question, the default value will be assumed.
   3. Edition of the param_card/run_card can be scripted via the "set" command of the associate question.
Finally you have to run the script as:
./bin/mg5_aMC PATH_TO_FILE

Here is an example of a script performing a scan on the top mass

    generate p p > t t~ j
    output MYDIRECTORY
    launch MYDIRECTORY
       set mt 170 # changing the top mass
       set wt Auto # changing the top width
       set ptj 40 # changing the ptj cut
   launch
       set mt 175 # changing the top mass
       set wt Auto # changing the top width
   launch
       set mt 180 # changing the top mass
       set wt Auto # changing the top width
   launch MYDIRECTORY -i
       print_results --path=./cross_section_top.txt --format=short
Note that

  1. The last two command allow you to have a multi-column file with the cross-section/error/... for each of the run
  2. The same can be done with the ./bin/madevent and ./bin/amcatnlo executable.
  3. Indentation in the script file is not important
